#10) This question uses the following people's ages: 19,23,30,30,45,25,24,20. Store them in R using the syntax ages<-c(19,23,30,30,45,25,24,20).

#a) Compute the standard deviation in R using the sd() function.
```{r}
ages<-c(19,23,30,30,45,25,24,20)
sd(ages)

```
#b) Compute the same value by hand and show all the steps.
```{r}

```
#c) Using R, how does the value in part a change if you add 10 to all the values?
```{r}
sd(ages+10) 
```
```{r}
#it does not change
```
#d) Using R, how does the value in part a change if you multiply all the values by 100?
```{r}
sd(100*ages) 
```
```{r}
# It is multiplied by 100. 
```
